                    This Lemon Ginger Honey Water is refreshing and hydrating. 

                    It’s the perfect drink to begin your day with (try it 30 minutes 
                    or more before or after celery juice), for an afternoon pick me up, 
                    or to sip on over the day. 

                    When you drink this healing tonic when you first wake up,
                    it will help your liver flush out toxins it’s collected for release 
                    throughout the night while giving your liver and body the critical hydration 
                    and glucose it needs to begin your day.

                    Lemons and limes contain micro mineral salts that break down pathogens such as unproductive 
                    bacteria, mold, yeast, and fungus to help protect your liver’s immune system.

                    The rich calcium levels in lemons and limes binds to the vitamin C within them, 
                    and both of these enter into the liver, where they waken a stagnant, sluggish, fatty liver, 
                    helping loosen and disperse fat cells.

                    Ginger aids is known to greatly aid in digestion and assimilation and is widely 
                    regarded to help prevent colds, flu, motion sickness, and vertigo. 
                    
                    Ginger can also help to alleviate menstrual cramps, nausea, heart burn, migraines, 
                    sore throats, exhaustion, fatigue, and constipation and it is great in providing relief 
                    from the stomach flu and food poisoning.

                    Raw honey contains a combination of sugar that the liver needs desperately and vitamins, 
                    minerals, and other nutrients—hundreds of which are not on the record with medical research 
                    and science. 
                    
                    Raw honey is antimicrobial: antiviral, antibacterial, antifungal, all packaged into one. 
                    
                    When it heads to the liver in its broken down, assimilated state, it packs a punch, 
                    giving the liver everything it needs at once: the liver’s immune system strengthens instantly.
