            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Lemon water is the perfect way to hydrate, 
                    purify, and revitalize your body each morning.

                    Water coming straight from the tap or a bottle has lost its 
                    vitality and its innate living structure. 

                    By adding fresh squeezed lemon juice, you “wake up” the water 
                    and bring it back to life. 
                    
                    This allows it to travel more deeply into your tissues and cells 
                    and carry the essential nutrients and compounds you need in order to thrive.
                </p>

                    Lemon water is a good source of vitamins C and B and minerals 
                    such as calcium and magnesium. 
                    
                    Lemon water is excellent for weight loss, the immune system, 
                    alkalizing the body, controlling high blood pressure, anti-aging, 
                    detoxification, purifying the blood, and regulating body temperature. 
                    
                    Lemon water is particularly beneficial for the digestive tract and can 
                    help relieve constipation, nausea, and even parasites.
                </p>

                    Lemon water is also good for the cardiovascular and muscular system 
                    making it an ideal drink before and after exercise. 
                    
                    Consider an early morning ritual of squeezing half a lemon into 
                    16oz (or more) of your best quality purified water upon waking. 
                    
                    This deep form of hydration will awaken your mind and energize your 
                    body for the day.

                    Lemon/lime water has the added benefit of helping to break up 
                    any sediment and stones in the gallbladder, allowing for bile 
                    production in the liver to increase, hydrochloric acid levels 
                    in the gut to rise, and reduction of the bad acids that cause acid 
                    reflux.
